    <title>Review for 10th Grade</title>
    <url>/2023/08/31/Review%20for%2010th%20Grade/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is a review for my tenth grade. I changed a lot in this year and had more realization on the world.<br>I learnt different things as before. It was the first time that I contact with foreigh teaching materials and found the ways of solving problems were extremely different with that in our country. I knew many people too, both positive and negative, which stimulated my social skills.</p>
<p>However, there was one thing that I wanted to mention was that my ability of language increased a lot. Unlike some of my classmates, their middle schools were international school. My middle school was normal school, thus I didn’t spent a lot time on English. Before I read 10 Grade, my IELTs mark was only about 4.5 points. I almost didn’t understood any word in the recording and didn’t recognized any word in the article. I thought that it was impossible to band high marks in the IELTs test at that time. Since that, I started to recite words and listen to the recording.. I also took an IELTS class. At first, I learned these things with great difficulty and boredom. In addition to reciting words, I can barely stick to other tasks, which are as difficult for me as climbing mountains<br>I also took an IELTS class. At first, I learned these things with great difficulty and boredom. Except reciting words, I can barely stick to other tasks, which are as difficult for me as climbing high mountains. At the end of last year, I found that I could understood some sentences while doing some reading. When doing listening, I can also understand a few sentences. My writing is getting better and better. My oral English is also getting better and better.<br>My first IELTS test was in early March, and after several months of training, I was able to get more than half of the questions right. I can write high levels of sentences in the writing test and answer questions fluently in oral test. When I review last few years, it was amazing that I improved my English a lot, which was from non-ability to high levels.</p>

    <title>X Academy</title>
    <url>/2023/09/03/X-Academy/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of August, I participated in a program called X Academy. This project includes two major parts. One is elective academy, the other is that finish the work by your team.(Work can be considered as film,game,application,case study or design)</p>
<p>For most point that impressed me was that ways of creating the game. Concerning well-known games like CSGO, these kind of games need high level of technology and time. But if we consider games as creators’ vision, we would find that it was difficult to create game, even game like PVZ. In the curriculum, we used the application named “Unity” to create game. When I entered the application, there were only two objects which were camera and light. This means any other things need to be created by myself. During these days, I learnt some basic scripts and components.I realized that there were some many elements in such a simple game.Especially for its logic, it gave me a world with full of logic and models, which makes me have a new sight to the game.In every game, every object has its own component and relationship related to other objects.It is a hard work that makes everything logically and rigorously.So game was a mixture of logic, which impress me a lot and stimulate the interest.<br>I knew more about games during these days and understood a lot of logic of the world. Also, I had more knowledge about academies in the university and situation about universities in other countries.<br>Then I wrote some reviews for myself.<br>I think I did something well during  these days. The most wonderful point  is that I successfully overcome difficulty of writing scripts. Writing scripts is a main part of creating games, it includes a lot of functions which are extremely complex. For instance, our team’s capstone was a musical game, but we didn’t have knowledge to make this game, especially writing scripts. We didn’t want to give up so we tried to learn it on websites. My main job was writing scripts, thus I started to learn scripts from bilibili. It was really hard for me so I learnt it for six hours. Then I spent three hours trying to writing scripts, which were all functions. Even though I failed for many times, but with help of AL, I finally made it. Another point is that I did well in communicating with others, I made a lot of friends during these days and have encourages to share ideas with academy leaders and teachers.<br>However, I had some drawbacks during these days. Firstly, I didn’t control myself well so that I slept late every day. I felt uncomfortable sometimes. Secondly, I always asked others when every activities started. This because I didn’t have enough confidence. Actually, I haven’t changed myself yet.<br>Here’s details for capstone.<br>Our capstone is a kind of musical game. Our team purpose was announced the effect of net violence by this game. There was an important point was that every note displayed a negative review. Our game included two parts, one was the story and the other was game.Firstly, game presented background of story(The new was reported about a girl and protagonist started to write negative reviews for her).Then the game begun, as you finished the game. It turned to the end. There were two ends which were good end and bad end. It depended on the score you got.To finished the game, our team made division of work.(UI,art,management,scripts) We faced a lot of trouble but we were successful at last.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>After the final test,my parents went to travel to other places,so I need to live alone.This was really distinctive experience.<br>On the first day,I woke up as common as before.

I took about one hour to finish.As I went home, there was housework that I need to do.Without parents, life become more busy.I have to do a lot of things that my parents do such as sweeping floor and feed pet.I found that the time I can do things freely only was here hours,which much less than that before.</p>
<p>On the second day,I tried to made breakfast by myself.It was really difficult to made and wash the dishes.But I did better than before.The same as yesterday, even though it was boring, but I did them patiently .<br>For next few days,I did these housework more and more patiently,. I also found that I did them more efficiently than before.</p>
<p>In this period .I started to do many things that I never had done before.I felt that I can did more things for family.I also realized how my parents busily live and do these housework patiently.The most important is that I learned the living and communication skills.During that week, I tried to communicated people for meal and living things, which makes me live better in the society.Also, I can deal many things by myself and I don’t need to rely on my parents for many things.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>About one month ago, I experienced my first IELTS test and I got 6.0 in my test.Actually, it it surprised to me when I checked my marks. To occur this result,it started from August in last year and mainly by six months hard work.<br>In last August, I started to learn IELTs. I remembered that my first lesson was listening test. I didn’t hear clearly about listening recording and I felt that it was the language in India. There was same situation in reading class, writing class and speaking class. I almost couldn’t understand anything.<br>I was worried about it. So I attended IELTs classes by myself, I asked a lot of question to my teachers such as how I could improve marks and how long I could achieve ideal marks. In the beginning, I did them hard and accuracy was approximately 0%.I was very dissapointing about it and wanted to give up. But my parents encourage and told me that only hard work can achieve success. After that, I tried my best to study and I asked teachers problems until I know the solution. In March, my English skills improved a lot and was confident to my test.<br>During 6 months, I have grown up a lot and I knew the meaning of hard working. I also found that process was excellent instead of boring.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In economic class my classmates and we were divided into several economic groups , each group had three or four members . Then our economic teacher required us to choose a topic to explain and conclude the important points.<br>We choose the topic about externality. My job was to reported our task and made decision of group. I divided the knowledge of externality  into several parts.They were what was externality external costs, external benefits, and ways of reducing external costs.<br>I built a wechat group and discussed with my teammates about the task. I thought that I was aleader so I should choose the most important and complex part–the ways of reducing external costs.I also give tasks which was making ppt about one part to my teammates.But some of members are not happy with their task.I started a video call with my members and asked the situation.I thought the ideas for dealing with problem.Finally,I decided that let them wrote down what tasks they wanted to do.They agreed with me and told me what they wanted to do.Three of them all wanted to do the part about external benefits.It was a difficult problem for me.But I came up with an idea that they don’t have to do the part,they cando the two parts but needn’t do all.We solved the problems.Then I began my task.I firstly arranged the ways of reducing external costs.Then I used PPT to wrote about it. At last, I used several examples to make my ppt more wonderful.<br>In that day, we did a good work and I felt very happy. This was the thing which occured for few days ago.For me,it was not only the experience for team,but also improved my social skills and communication skills,which can help me more easily face the problems in the future such as relationship between colleagues.Moreover, I knew the importance of teamwork.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>You can’t have the cake and eat it.This is an idea,which was from Mencius.That means if you do one thing,you will unable to do the another one.<br>But I have some questions about it,because I think it too extreme.For instance,the basketball player Vince Carter,he was once the superstar in the NBA.He was famous for his beautiful dunk and fantastic basketball skills.But he is not only good at playing basketball,he does well in playing the violin too.He achieved the balance between music and basketball.So I don’t think this idea is true.<br>Foe me,examples that are overthrowing this idea make me prompte my thinking.I can often make two things achieve the balance and deal these things well.What’s more,sometimes I can get the maximum benefits by dealing things.This  also make me prompte my thinking.<br>I always try to find the new way to deal the things.So there’s some outcomes that make me do things efficiently.Moreover,I have improved my thinking skills and social skills by prompting.</p>
