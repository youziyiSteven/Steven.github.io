    <title>Review for 10th Grade</title>
    <url>/2023/08/31/Review%20for%2010th%20Grade/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is a review for my tenth grade. I changed a lot in this year and had more realization on the world.<br>I learnt different things as before. It was the first time that I contact with foreigh teaching materials and found the ways of solving problems were extremely different with that in our country. I knew many people too, both positive and negative, which stimulated my social skills.</p>
<p>However, there was one thing that I wanted to mention was that my ability of language increased a lot. Unlike some of my classmates, their middle schools were international school. My middle school was normal school, thus I didn’t spent a lot time on English. Before I read 10 Grade, my IELTs mark was only about 4.5 points. I almost didn’t understood any word in the recording and didn’t recognized any word in the article. I thought that it was impossible to band high marks in the IELTs test at that time. Since that, I started to recite words and listen to the recording.. I also took an IELTS class. At first, I learned these things with great difficulty and boredom. In addition to reciting words, I can barely stick to other tasks, which are as difficult for me as climbing mountains<br>I also took an IELTS class. At first, I learned these things with great difficulty and boredom. Except reciting words, I can barely stick to other tasks, which are as difficult for me as climbing high mountains. At the end of last year, I found that I could understood some sentences while doing some reading. When doing listening, I can also understand a few sentences. My writing is getting better and better. My oral English is also getting better and better.<br>My first IELTS test was in early March, and after several months of training, I was able to get more than half of the questions right. I can write high levels of sentences in the writing test and answer questions fluently in oral test. When I review last few years, it was amazing that I improved my English a lot, which was from non-ability to high levels.</p>
