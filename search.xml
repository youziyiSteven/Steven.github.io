    <title>Review for 10th Grade</title>
    <url>/2023/08/31/Review%20for%2010th%20Grade/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is a review for my tenth grade. I changed a lot in this year and had more realization on the world.<br>I learnt different things as before. It was the first time that I contact with foreigh teaching materials and found the ways of solving problems were extremely different with that in our country. I knew many people too, both positive and negative, which stimulated my social skills.</p>
<p>However, there was one thing that I wanted to mention was that my ability of language increased a lot. Unlike some of my classmates, their middle schools were international school. My middle school was normal school, thus I didn’t spent a lot time on English. Before I read 10 Grade, my IELTs mark was only about 4.5 points. I almost didn’t understood any word in the recording and didn’t recognized any word in the article. I thought that it was impossible to band high marks in the IELTs test at that time. Since that, I started to recite words and listen to the recording.. I also took an IELTS class. At first, I learned these things with great difficulty and boredom. In addition to reciting words, I can barely stick to other tasks, which are as difficult for me as climbing mountains<br>I also took an IELTS class. At first, I learned these things with great difficulty and boredom. Except reciting words, I can barely stick to other tasks, which are as difficult for me as climbing high mountains. At the end of last year, I found that I could understood some sentences while doing some reading. When doing listening, I can also understand a few sentences. My writing is getting better and better. My oral English is also getting better and better.<br>My first IELTS test was in early March, and after several months of training, I was able to get more than half of the questions right. I can write high levels of sentences in the writing test and answer questions fluently in oral test. When I review last few years, it was amazing that I improved my English a lot, which was from non-ability to high levels.</p>

    <title>X Academy</title>
    <url>/2023/09/03/X-Academy/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of August, I participated in a program called X Academy. This project includes two major parts. One is elective academy, the other is that finish the work by your team.(Work can be considered as film,game,application,case study or design)</p>
<p>For most point that impressed me was that ways of creating the game. Concerning well-known games like CSGO, these kind of games need high level of technology and time. But if we consider games as creators’ vision, we would find that it was difficult to create game, even game like PVZ. In the curriculum, we used the application named “Unity” to create game. When I entered the application, there were only two objects which were camera and light. This means any other things need to be created by myself. During these days, I learnt some basic scripts and components.I realized that there were some many elements in such a simple game.Especially for its logic, it gave me a world with full of logic and models, which makes me have a new sight to the game.In every game, every object has its own component and relationship related to other objects.It is a hard work that makes everything logically and rigorously.So game was a mixture of logic, which impress me a lot and stimulate the interest.<br>I knew more about games during these days and understood a lot of logic of the world. Also, I had more knowledge about academies in the university and situation about universities in other countries.<br>Then I wrote some reviews for myself.<br>I think I did something well during  these days. The most wonderful point  is that I successfully overcome difficulty of writing scripts. Writing scripts is a main part of creating games, it includes a lot of functions which are extremely complex. For instance, our team’s capstone was a musical game, but we didn’t have knowledge to make this game, especially writing scripts. We didn’t want to give up so we tried to learn it on websites. My main job was writing scripts, thus I started to learn scripts from bilibili. It was really hard for me so I learnt it for six hours. Then I spent three hours trying to writing scripts, which were all functions. Even though I failed for many times, but with help of AL, I finally made it. Another point is that I did well in communicating with others, I made a lot of friends during these days and have encourages to share ideas with academy leaders and teachers.<br>However, I had some drawbacks during these days. Firstly, I didn’t control myself well so that I slept late every day. I felt uncomfortable sometimes. Secondly, I always asked others when every activities started. This because I didn’t have enough confidence. Actually, I haven’t changed myself yet.<br>Here’s details for capstone.<br>Our capstone is a kind of musical game. Our team purpose was announced the effect of net violence by this game. There was an important point was that every note displayed a negative review. Our game included two parts, one was the story and the other was game.Firstly, game presented background of story(The new was reported about a girl and protagonist started to write negative reviews for her).Then the game begun, as you finished the game. It turned to the end. There were two ends which were good end and bad end. It depended on the score you got.To finished the game, our team made division of work.(UI,art,management,scripts) We faced a lot of trouble but we were successful at last.</p>
